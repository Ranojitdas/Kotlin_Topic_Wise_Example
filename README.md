## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and explore this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ranojitdas/Kotlin_Topic_Wise_Example.git
   ```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (recommended) or any Kotlin-supporting IDE.

3. Browse the folders for topic-wise examples. Each `.kt` file is self-contained and includes comments for clarity.

4. Run the examples directly in your IDE or use the Kotlin command-line tools.

## 🔍 How to Use

- **Find a topic**: Navigate to the relevant folder for the concept you want to learn or review.
- **Explore the code**: Open `.kt` files to see concise, commented examples.
- **Experiment**: Modify and run the code in your IDE to deepen your understanding.
- **Search**: Use your IDE's search features to quickly find keywords or topics.

## 💡 Example Usage

Here's how an example file might look:

```kotlin
// File: basics/Variables.kt

fun main() {
    // Immutable variable
    val name: String = "Kotlin"
    // Mutable variable
    var age: Int = 5

    println("Language: $name, Age: $age")
}
```

**Output:**
```
Language: Kotlin, Age: 5
```

Files are kept minimal and focused for easy copying and experimentation.
Comments explain the concept being demonstrated.
